# Limitations

While Newton allows for a considerable number of particles, adding an excessive amount can impact performance and result in frame jank. 
Please be mindful of the particle count to maintain smooth animations. 

Currently, resizing the animation area does not affect particle travel. 
However, rest assured, we are actively working on numerous enhancements to further optimize the library. 

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
