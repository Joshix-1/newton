# Why Newton?

Welcome to Newton, where the desire to effortlessly create stunning particle animations drives us. 
Newton empowers you to deliver high-impact visual effects that captivate your users. 
With Newton, particles are the single entities traveling through space and time, while effects emit these particles, resulting in mesmerizing animations. 
Whether you're looking for single-point or multi-point particle emission, Newton's highly configurable and easily extensible library provides the flexibility you need. 

Dive into our [configurator](/docs/configurator) to fine-tune effects, or explore the [Custom Effect](/docs/custom) section to craft unique animations that leave a lasting impression on your audience.
